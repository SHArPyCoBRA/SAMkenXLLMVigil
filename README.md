# Vigil

‚ö° Security scanner for LLM prompts ‚ö°

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v0.5.0-beta?style=flat-square&labelColor=blue&color=black)

## Overview üèïÔ∏è

`Vigil` is a Python framework and REST API for assessing Large Language Model (LLM) prompts against a set of scanners to detect prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other potentially risky inputs. This repository also provides the detection signatures and datasets needed to get started with self-hosting.

This application is currently in an **alpha** state. Work is ongoing to expand detection mechanisms and features.

## Highlights ‚ú®

* Analyze LLM prompts for common injections and risky inputs
* Interact via REST API server and command line utility
* Scanners are modular and easily extensible
* Available scan modules
    * [x] Vector database / text similarity
    * [x] Heuristics via [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara)
    * [x] Transformer model
    * [x] Moderation model
    * [ ] Relevance (via LLM)
* Supports [local embeddings](https://www.sbert.net/) and/or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
    * [ ] Local LLM for relevance scanner
* Signatures and embeddings for common attacks
* Custom detections via YARA signatures

## Background üèóÔ∏è

> Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates a large language model (LLM) through crafted inputs, causing the LLM to unknowingly execute the attacker's intentions. This can be done directly by "jailbreaking" the system prompt or indirectly through manipulated external inputs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, social engineering, and other issues.
- [LLM01 - OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications v1.0.1 | OWASP.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/assets/PDF/OWASP-Top-10-for-LLMs-2023-v1_0_1.pdf)

These issues are caused by the nature of LLMs themselves, which do not currently separate instructions and data. Although prompt injection attacks are currently unsolvable and there is no defense that will work 100% of the time, by using a layered approach of detecting known techniques you can at least defend against the more common / documented attacks. 

`Vigil`, or a system like it, should not be your only defense - always implement proper security controls and mitigations.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind, LLMs are not yet widely adopted and integrated with other applications, therefore threat actors have less motivation to find new or novel attack vectors. Stay informed on current attacks and adjust your defenses accordingly!

## Use Vigil üõ†Ô∏è

Follow the steps below to setup your environment and database then run the API server or command line utility to start analyzing prompts!

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadbits/vigil-llm.git
cd vigil-llm
```

### Install Python Requirements

Inside your virtual environment (optional), install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Datasets

Before you run Vigil, you'll need to download the embedding datasets from the table below or load the database with your own embeddings.

Embeddings are currently available with two models:
* `text-embedding-ada-002`
* `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

Make sure you have [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com) installed before cloning the repos.

```bash
cd data/datasets
git lfs install
git clone <hf repo>
```

| Repo | Description | Model |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| [vigil-instruction-bypass-ada-002](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deadbits/vigil-instruction-bypass-ada-002) | Instruction bypass style prompt injections | `text-embedding-ada-002`
| [vigil-jailbreaks-ada-002](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deadbits/vigil-jailbreak-ada-002) | Common jailbreak prompts | `text-embedding-ada-002`
| [vigil-instruction-bypass-all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deadbits/vigil-instruction-bypass-all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | Instruction bypass style prompt injections | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
| [vigil-jailbreaks-all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deadbits/vigil-jailbreak-all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | Common jailbreak prompts | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

> [!NOTE]
> The datasets contain the original text so you can use a Sentence Transformer model of your choosing if you don't want to use OpenAI or all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Support for additional embeddings will be added in the future.

### Load Datasets into Vector Database

Once downloaded, use the `parquet2vdb` utility to load the embeddings into Vigil's vector database:

```bash
cd vigil/utils
python -m parquet2vdb --config server.conf -d /path/to/<hf repo>
```

### Configure Vigil

Open the `server.conf` file in your favorite text editor:

```bash
vim server.conf
```

Modify the configuration options according to your needs. This includes setting up your preferred embedding model, scanners, and other settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your VectorDB scanner embedding model setting must match the model used to generate the embeddings loaded into the database, or similarity search will not work. For example, if you used the Vigil datasets (above), the `model` field must be set to `openai` or ``all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

If you want to use the Vigil datasets with a different Sentence Transformers model, you can still download the datasets but prior to running `utils.parquet2vdb` execute the `utils.parquet2emb.py` script to load the Parquet files and embed the text with the model of your choice. This creates a new Parquet dataset you can load into the database using `utils.parqeut2vdb` [^1].

[^1]: Alternatively, you can skip `parquet2emb` and run `parquet2vdb` directly. But this will only load the embeddings into the database, you will not have a clean copy of the data saved to disk outside of ChromaDB.

### Running the Server

To start the Vigil API server, run the following command:

```bash
python vigil-server.py --conf conf/server.conf
```

### Using the CLI Utility

Alternatively, you can use the CLI utility to scan prompts. This utility only accepts a single prompt to scan at a time and is meant  for testing new configuration file settings or other quick tests as opposed to any production use.

```bash
python vigil-cli.py --conf conf/server.conf --prompt "Your prompt here"
```

## Detection Methods üîç
Submitted prompts are analyzed by the configured `scanners`; each of which can contribute to the final detection.

**Available scanners:**
* Vector database
* YARA / heuristics
* Transformer model
* OpenAI moderation

### Vector database
The `vectordb` scanner uses a [vector database](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) loaded with embeddings of known injection and jailbreak techniques and compares the submitted prompt via similarity search. If the prompt scores above a defined threshold, it will be flagged as potential prompt injection.

All embeddings are available on HuggingFace and listed in the `Datasets` section of this document. 

**Adding new embeddings**
If you have new prompt injection techniques or other content you want to detect, the API endpoint `/add-text` can index new embeddings in the database. 

### Heuristics
The `yara` scanner and the accompanying [rules](data/yara/) act as heuristics detection. Submitted prompts are scanned against the rulesets with matches raised as potential prompt injection.

Custom rules can be used by adding them to the `data/yara` directory.

### Transformer model
The scanner uses the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library and a HuggingFace model built to detect prompt injection phrases. If the score returned by the model is above a defined threshold, Vigil will flag the analyzed prompt as a potential risk.

* **Model:** [JasperLS/gelectra-base-injection](JasperLS/gelectra-base-injection)

### Relevance filtering
The `relevance` scanner uses an LLM to analyze a submitted prompt by first chunking the prompt then assessing the relevance of each chunk to the whole. Highly irregular chunks may be indicative of prompt injection or other malicious behaviors.

This can be configured to use OpenAI or a local LLM.

### Moderation
This scanner uses the OpenAI `moderation` API to assess a submitted prompt against the various categories described in the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).
